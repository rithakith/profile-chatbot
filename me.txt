Summary
Hi, I’m , a passionate IT undergraduate currently in my second
year at the Faculty of IT. During my first year, I was honored to
be selected as one of only 40 individuals out of 1,500+ applicants
for the prestigious Calcey Springboard Scholarship program. This
opportunity, offered by Calcey, a Gartner-recognized software
development and IT consulting company in Sri Lanka, provided me
with invaluable skills and insights into the IT industry.
In addition to this, I developed a hardware project called the " "
using IoT technology. This project was a significant part of my first
year and demonstrated my interest in integrating hardware with
software solutions.
Following my scholarship, I embarked on a 6-month at Calcey,
where I gained hands-on experience in UX, test case writing, bug
reporting, and regression testing. Despite my enriching experience
in QA, my true passion lies in development. I actively participate in
hackathons and competitions to hone my skills, and I’m familiar with
a range of technologies including , , ., , , ., , .
One of my proudest achievements was leading my team to a -
finish ., Sri Lanka's leading Advanced Analytics Competition. My
enthusiasm for AI and LLMs drives me to continuously explore and
learn in this exciting field.
In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am deeply
involved in volunteering. I am an active member of and currently
co-chair a project for FESTX by . Teaching and mentoring are also
close to my heart—I’ve organized kuppi sessions for my peers and
enjoy helping others grow.
